## Carbon and capture

1. In principle carbon border taxes are a good idea. In practice they could be a gift to protectionists.

2. Carbon prices are the most cost-effective way to fight climate change--but for them to work properly, emissions must be priced everywhere.

3. The idea is to stop European firms from responding to the carbon price by moving production to parts of the world where they can pollute without penalty, to shield them from being undercut by rivals from such places and to encourage foreign firm who want to sell to Europe to go green.

4. Market forces would find the cheapest ways to cut emissions. Yet a worldwide carbon market is a pipe dream.

5. Cheap imports bring lower prices, more choice, higher productivity and incentives to innovate.

6. **Society admits no right, legal or moral, in the disappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering.**

7. The opportunity to pollute the atmosphere without penalty is itself a kind of **distorting** **subsidy**.

8. Preventing climate change is a global public good, meaning every country`s citizens have a direct interest in reducing emission wherever they happen.

9. The problems with carbon tariffs are thus not moral or economic but practical and political.

10. It is just about possible to imagine a successful path to a global carbon price that involves tariffs.

    欧洲计划对于所有进入欧洲商品实行碳税，防止之欧洲供货商在别地生产商品而免予责罚，对于气候变暖应该是全球所有人的责任，同时本文还探讨了各国实行不同碳税，有可能被视为保护主义，保护本国商品生产和工业。
