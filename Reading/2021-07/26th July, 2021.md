## Bartleby England v Italy managers (TE - 20210717)

1. It was the duty of players “to continue to interact with the public on matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice, while using the power of their voices to help put debates on the table, raise awareness and educate“.
2. Italy`s eventual victory makes it tempting to argue that this proves the greater virtues of a more aggressive style of management pursued by Mr Mancini.
3. The team were level after normal time and extra time; had one of England`s penalties hit the inside of the post instead of the outside, the outcome might have been different.
4. Mr Southgate is widely admired for his politeness and modesty.
5. But it only succeeds if it is accompanied by other qualities.
6. What unites Messrs Mancini and Southgate is their meticulous attention to detail.
