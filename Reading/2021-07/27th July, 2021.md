## Burning down the house (TE - 20210724)

**happy birthday to myself!!!**

1. By the standards of the rest of human history its weather looks disconcertingly like hell.
2. There has been barely any **respite** from **searingly** hot conditions along the northern Pacific coast of North America since the region was hit by an unprecedented heatwave two weeks ago, and already the region is bracing for another.
3. The amount of sea-ice cover in the Arctic was as low as it was at the same point in 2012, which saw the lowest summer sea ice ever recorded.
4. They expected, or hoped, that countries would make new and more ambitious pledges as    technology progressed, as confidence that they were all really on board built up and as international co-ordination improved.
5. The **caveat** is that this estimate includes policies announced but not enacted.
6. And although there is no doubt that greenhouse gases influence climate and are driving the rising temperatures seen around the world, difficulties in untangling various feedback loops and complex countervailing effects mean that there remains considerable uncertainty about how much further climate change a given amount of greenhouse gas brings about.
7. Human bodies cool off through the evaporation of sweat, and under **humid** conditions evaporation is harder.
