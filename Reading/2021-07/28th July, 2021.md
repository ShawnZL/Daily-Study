## Floating wind turbines could rise to great heights (TE - 20210724)

1. They were, they said, jointly submitting proposals to the British authorities to build, off coast of Scotland, the first large-scale set of floating wind farms in the world.
2. Offshore wind farms with foundations in the seabed are now part of the energy mix in several places.
3. First, unlike an oil rig, a wind turbine is **lanky** and top-heavy, making it prone to **tip** over.
4. It was hard, in those days, to see how these problems could be solved cheaply enough to compete with turbines **bolted** to the ocean floor--much less with conventional power sources.
5. Bigger farms obviously require more turbines. But they also, ideally, require bigger turbines.
6. Floating turbines will, however, operate in waters too deep for jackup vessels to work, so any vessel servicing one will have, itself, to remain floating.
7. Some observers detect a **whiff** of greenwashing.(electric island)
